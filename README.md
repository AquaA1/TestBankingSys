## 📌 About the Project

**TestBankingSys** is a console-based banking system built using Python.  
This project is still under development and is mainly created to improve my understanding of real-world programming concepts such as authentication, data storage, security, and error handling.

The system allows users to create bank accounts, manage money transactions, and securely store data using a JSON file.  
An admin section is also available to monitor all registered users.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 👤 User Features
- User registration and login system
- Secure password hashing using `hashlib`
- Hidden password input using `getpass`
- Deposit and withdrawal functionality
- Change password option
- Improved input validation to prevent crashes
- Colored terminal output for better readability
- 

### 🔐 Security
- Passwords are stored only in hashed form
- No plain-text password storage
- Secure password input

### 🛠 Admin Features
- Admin login
- View all user data stored in the system

## 🗂 Data Storage
- User data is stored in a **JSON file**, acting as a simple database
- Stores:
  - User credentials (hashed)
  - Account balance
  - Loan details (Not added)
  - Transaction-related information

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I am learning:
- File handling using JSON
- Password hashing and basic security practices
- Function-based program structure
- Error handling and input validation
- Designing a small-scale real-world application

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements (To Do)
- Transaction history for users
- Forgot password functionality
- Improved loan management system (not added)
- Better admin controls and analytics
- Code refactoring for scalability
